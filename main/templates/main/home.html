            My name is Arman Ryan Mehzad. I am a thesis-track masters student at The Ohio State University (tOSU) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in the Solid State Electronics and Photonics (SSEP) focus. My research currently involves the design, fabrication, and testing of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) for biosensing applications.
            Before I began my graduate-level classes and studies in SSEP, I worked on two research projects involving non-invasive neuromodulation within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. These projects involved low-intensity focused ultrasound and photobiomodulation as the respective stimulation modalities. I received my bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Electrical Engineering from tOSU in May 2025.
